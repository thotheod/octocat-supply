# Commit Message Instructions

Use conventional commit message format. Prefix commit messages with one of the following types:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting, white-space, etc. (no code logic changes)
- `refactor:` for code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `test:` for adding or updating tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks (e.g., dependencies, build scripts)

### Examples:

- `feat: add mood logging form component`
- `fix: resolve issue with mood JSON storage`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`
- `refactor: simplify mood fetching logic`
- `test: add unit tests for MoodForm component`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
